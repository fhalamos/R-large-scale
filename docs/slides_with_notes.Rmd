Workshop aims
=============

1. Develop skills for large-scale data analyis in R, and apply these
skills to a large-ish data set.

2. Learn how to use R **non-interactively** within a high-performance
computing (HPC) environment.

3. Assess memory needs, and make effective use of it.

4. Use simple parallelization techniques.

5. Use C++ to speedup intensive computations in R.

6. Learn through **live coding**---this includes learning from our
mistakes!
