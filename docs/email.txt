Subject: Please read for tomorrow's R workshop

Thank you for registering for the RCC workshop, "Large-Scale Data
Analysis in R". It is taking place tomorrow (Thursday, April 11), 2–5p
in the Zar Room, which is in the John Crerar Library.

This workshop is not an introduction to R—it is intended for students
and researchers who already have experience using R. You will get the
most out of this workshop if you have an RCC account, you have used
midway2, and you are familiar with basic UNIX shell commands. (If you
do not have an RCC account, please see below.)

If you cannot attend, please cancel your registration on the
Eventbrite website. This will help me get a better sense of workshop
size.

This is a hands-on tutorial, so you will get the most benefit from the
tutorial if you bring your laptop and work through the examples
in-class. We will be using the RCC cluster for all the examples.

If you have an RCC account, please make sure you are able to log in to
midway2. See the instructions in the User Guide:

If you do not have an RCC account, I will provide you with guest
access. However, to use the guest account you will need an SSH
client. So please make sure you have an SSH client installed on your
computer before coming to the workshop. (If you have macOS or Linux,
you most likely have SSH.) For further explanation, go the above User
Guide page. You will also need a USB-A port, or an adapter for USB-A.
(The newer USB ports are smaller than USB-A, so require an adapter.)

At the beginning of the workshop, I will provide you with additional
setup instructions.
